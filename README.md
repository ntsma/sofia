Online Primary Care Interactive Strengthening System

The Telehealth Brazil Networks Program is a national action that seeks to improve the quality of care and primary care in the Unified Health System (SUS), integrating teaching and service through computer tools, which offers conditions to promote telecare and tele-education. Regarding telecare, the Telehealth Center of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Maranh√£o (NTS HU-UFMA) is made up of Teleconsultation services, which provide assistance for health actions, clinical procedures and issues related to work processes. In three years (2015-2018), the center used the Ministry of Health's web platform to offer the teleconsultation services offered. Subsequently, for better process analysis, the center developed the SMGT management and monitoring system to transform all data into analytical information. But integration with these two platforms was still done manually, with daily download and digital spreadsheet upload to update the database. Thus, in February 2018, the center began developing its own platform, called SOFIA, and launched it in August 2018. The main objective was to have a center-dependent system environment (full integration with SGAT and SMGT), improve analysis of the entire process and develop new resources for a better experience of registered health professionals.

Sofia is a mobile application capable of handling the teleconsulting services offered by the center. In addition, it is integrated with all platforms developed by the center, creating a complete environment for NTS HU-UFMA registered health professionals.
